# DBA Skills

Look at the @README.md file and use it as the reference of what to build here.

Start by a planning phase. Do extensive research about the documentation and knowledge needed to each skill, write the research info in the claude-research/ folder for further usage.

Then, plan thoroughly the steps to build the skills, and write them in md files in the -claude-tasks/ directory.

Be very specific for the requirements, with all the best practices you'll find at https://agentskills.io/specification 

Make sure the skills will have the necessary references/ info, and examples/ info.
