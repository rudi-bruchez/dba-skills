# DBA Skills

You have already created the first sept : research, it's in the .foundry/research/gemini directory. 

You have also planned the steps to build the skills, in the .foundry/tasks/gemini/ directory.

Look also at the @README.md file as the reference of what to build here.

Now, create the skills in ./skills-gemini/ directory.

Make sure the skills will have the necessary references/ info, and examples/ info.

There are skills already existing, but don't look at them. I want you to prepare building YOUR skills, and then I will choose the best. So do your best !
